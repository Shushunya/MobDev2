Mobile development programming assignment 1

I decided to use AndroidStudio with Kotlin as programming language since it was too comlicated to use MacOS and Swift.

Mobile development programming assignment 2

Added 2 files: TimeOT.kt and Contents.kt up to the task.
The only problem was to test the results, so initially I checked all the Contents.kt results in Intellij Idea and used Log in this project.
